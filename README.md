# Final Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio!

This collection of samples display the coding experience that I've gained from participation in the Neural Data Science course offered by Dalhousie University. 
In context of my completion of this course, these the following examples are the result of the acheivement of the following learning objectives:

  -Extract meaning from data 

  -Organize and manipulate data structures 

  -Visualize data in a variety of graphical formats 

  -Work with continuous, discrete, and factorial data

  -Write functional and efficient code in Python 

  -Read and write data files in common formats such as CSV and Excel

  -Use online tools for collaborative software development and project management

  -Extend skills using online resources 

  -Perform exploratory data analysis using graphical and basic statistical operations 

  -Perform basic signal processing on data, such as filtering in temporal and spatial dimensions 

  -Build and run data processing pipelines on various types of neuroscientific data, including single unit recordings, time series, and 2D/3D/4D images 


### Data Analysis
This is a sample of code from the Datacamp project "Real-time Insights from Social Media Data". Twitter Data is analysed to explore trends and represented in a table format.

### Data Cleaning
This code is drawn from assignment 3 and shows how to inspect and clean data for further analysis. Data is inspected prior to removal of Nan values, practice trials, and repeating rows.

### Data Visualization 
Also from assignment 3, the data is visualized in multiple ways utilizing matplotlibs histogram plotting functions. Reaction time is represented using a normal histogram, a cumulative density function histogram, as well as versions using inverse and log transformed data.
