# Final Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio!

The following collection of samples display the coding experience that I've gained through participation in the Neural Data Science course offered by Dalhousie University .


### Data Cleaning 
This code is drawn from assignment 3 and shows how to inspect and clean data for further analysis. Data is inspected prior to removal of Nan values, practice trials, and repeating rows.

### Data Visualization 
Also from assignment 3, the data is visualized in multiple ways utilizing matplotlibs histogram plotting functions. Reaction time is represented using a normal histogram, a cumulative density function histogram, as well as versions using inverse and log transformed data.

### Data Analysis 
This is a sample of code from the Datacamp project "Real-time Insights from Social Media Data". Twitter Data is analysed to explore trends and represented in a table format.

### Subsetting with Groupby 
In this example, a large dataframe is subsetted into smaller groups based on specific conditions using the "groupby" method. Data statistics are then explored.

### Image Segmentation 
In this example I work with the MRI data of a heartbeat. This data is a 3D time series in which I manipulate to identify objects of interest.

(Magnetic resonance imaging data provided by the Sunnybrook Cardiac Dataset)

### Loop Conversion

This is an example of code that uses a loop to convert seconds into milliseconds.

### Duplicating Jupyter Notebooks

This is a demo I have produced that shows how to duplicate a Jupyter notebook. This allows individual to work on group projects separately, without altering the main notebook.
