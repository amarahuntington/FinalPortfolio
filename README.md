# Final Portfolio
The following is a collection of code that exhibits my experience with Python.

### Data Cleaning
This code is drawn from assignment 3 and shows how to inspect and clean data for further analysis. Data is inspected prior to removal of Nan values, practice trials, and repeating rows.
